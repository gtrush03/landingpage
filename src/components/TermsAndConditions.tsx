            <div className="space-y-4 text-white/80">
              <p>2.1. TRU Synth is a consulting-first, subscription-based service tailored for business leaders managing teams and looking to integrate AI-powered systems into their workflows.</p>
              <p>2.2. We specialize in digital strategy consulting, AI implementation, and advisory services that allow businesses to leverage AI without the need to onboard full-time AI personnel.</p>
              <p>2.3. Our core expertise lies in advising, designing, and deploying Digital Employees â€” AI-driven systems and workflows purpose-built to optimize business operations.</p>
              <p>2.4. We provide a hands-on, consulting-led approach, focusing on one client project at a time to ensure alignment with your strategic goals.</p>
              <p>2.5. Our services include both strategic AI consulting and the development of new AI-powered solutions; however, we do not modify pre-existing codebases but instead focus on designing fresh, scalable systems.</p>
              <p>2.6. While integration with your existing infrastructure is part of the consulting scope, direct modification of legacy systems falls outside our service boundaries unless explicitly agreed.</p>
